Everything is happening so quickly.</p> <p>I escaped from the Fearless Striders roughly a month ago. I have decided that I will keep my daggers and the\u00a0lieutenant's\u00a0gun though. It took me a while to process that moment. I do not regret killing him. But I do regret that I had to. If he saw me running, he would have killed me. And getting his gun made it possible for me to fend for myself on the way out. I was in hiding with a Crimson Wolves contact while the heat cooled a bit. Then I was stuck on a ship with a bunch of people who looked at me funny. They were respectful, sure, but they made it very clear that I stand out. Eventually, we got to Gatarobi Station. Never heard of it. Don't even know where we were. But it was there I met my new squad, and my handler.</p> <p>They seem nice enough. I am still gauging how much to let them know about me. No doubt they've noticed I don't have a name by now. But if I am to be relying on these people to keep me safe, and they rely on me for the same, then I am sure there will be time for us to bond.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we were immediately assigned to a mission upon reaching Gatarobi. We got some time to get accustomed to our quarters, but our luggage had not come by the time we were leaving. So I didn't even get a chance to unpack. All of my friends are still in the suitcase. I did get my hardsuit though. This thing will stay in my closet. I hate it. But I need to hold on to it. As a reminder of what I left, and what keeps me going. The Wolves have supplied a new hardsuit for me with a jump kit. I will have to get used to that, but I feel in time I will prefer that much more than the bulky armor I was wearing before.</p> <p>We are currently above a planet called\u00a0Cressidium. Supposed to just be some training by the sound of it, shouldn't be too much action. Most of the time so far has been staying in the gym, having some sparring matches with Koa Palmer, and eating whenever I can. Handler says I can eat as much as I like, as long as I am keeping active. I plan to hold her to that.</p> <p>Our handler, Seline Nguyen. Over the past few days since I've met her, she seems to actually care for our squad. Making sure we eat enough, get proper exercise, check up on us. Very much unlike the Striders. I have caught myself thinking about her during my free time. I have this urge to do my best for her, this woman I barely know. I want her to have pride in me. I cannot explain this feeling. But I will bring it up to her in the near future.</p>"},{"location":"Bun%20Book/02%20-%20Cressidium%20Deployment%2C%20Day%201/","title":"02   Cressidium Deployment, Day 1","text":"<p>This training exercise turns out to have been anything but. We were called to battle stations with very little notice. Barely even had enough time to put my suit on before being pushed into Muzzled Angel's cockpit. Lycaon was loaded onto a dropship to get to the ground, but we were shot out of the sky. The city was already torn to shreds. We had incoming MCs from the Sovereignty and we got radio transmissions that they were to \"clean up\" any survivors. I made sure to make it well known we survived by shooting a hole through the first mech I saw. They were quite surprised to find out they were not fighting Union soldiers, but rather Lancers from the Crimson Wolves.</p> <p>We lucked out at one point. Enemy reinforcements had arrived from the north, but Red Mura was just in time to give us a hand, taking them all out at once. I'll need to thank her later. Her assist left one hostile mech, which I disabled. The pilot, a shitbag named Broderick, surrendered to us and gave us a laser designator to call in a bombardment from the Sovereignty.</p> <p>After assisting some liberators in fixing their transport, we came under fire from Sovereignty forces during escort. Unfortunately, we lost the bus and had to retreat. During the commotion, Broderick somehow escaped from Gecko, who was holding him in their mech. I tried my best to kill him, as I promised Ms. Nguyen I would if he tried to run. But he got away\u2026 If I ever see him again, I will not fail my handler a second time.</p> <p>On our approach to our FOB, we came across a Sovereignty-controlled train yard. There was a Typhoon Rainmaker shooting down CW dropships, hiding behind the train cars in the yard. Likely the same one that hit us on the way down. It was a little touch-and-go for a while, but we were able to get the platform to rotate and expose the Rainmaker. I ended up using the bombardment we got from our prisoner to target it, and we were able to destroy it. Afterward, I had Angel take the head as a trophy.</p> <p>We got to our FOB after, and it was well past dark. We were welcomed by the Wolves who were there, and our mechs have been taken in for repair. Ms. Nguyen called and said that we would be getting access to some new toys after our successful mission. Looking forward to seeing what we have.</p> <p>We have been told we will have some downtime tomorrow. If there are any ships heading back to the Rio Grande, I will have to ask if someone can take the Rainmaker head and bring it to my room.</p>"},{"location":"Bun%20Book/03%20-%20Cressidium%20Deployment%2C%20Day%202/","title":"03   Cressidium Deployment, Day 2","text":"<p>After arriving at FOB Sabre, our LCs were taken away for repair and outfitting new toys. It was interesting to see the engineers so excited to see LCs. My time around L1 has made me forget that lancers are not common in the galaxy. I was able to pick up an XC-BR Battle Rifle. I am not sure if I will like it, due to it being able to overheat Angel, but I think the extended range on lock-on targets will be helpful when I need to keep my distance from a threat. After our mechs were taken, a dropship came in. Ms. Nguyen was onboard, and had two others with her. One was a drone that Ms. Nguyen said was linked to her, and she would be lending us some direct support in the field. It was able to provide lock-ons, among other functions. Good for us to have. I'll always take an easy target.</p> <p>The other was a new Wolf lancer. Gil Gallant, callsign Achilles. Her augments are\u2026strange. Very shoddily done. And she immediately went to get drunk after we were told we would have a few hours of downtime. But that aside, she has shown her prowess in combat. She will serve as a very effective frontline to help Jackal. Though this new firepower came at a cost. Gecko has left the Wolves, for reasons undisclosed to us. I have heard talk that some people just are not equipped to handle the life of being a mercenary. Which I suppose is fair, but is something I never considered. It is what I was raised to be. Starchild has also been put into reserve duty for now. Hopefully she will be back somewhat soon.</p> <p>After a bit of downtime, there was some explosion near the base. A VSAF soldier shot at one of our dropships and missed, but got away before they were found. But the dropship was carrying Squad Kalak. It was nice to see Koa again, so I could thank her properly for her assistance yesterday. I also got a chance to talk to her about Ms. Nguyen. She told me that she doesn't know much about Ms. Nguyen that I wouldn't already know, but when I told her my inquiry was less about learning of her and more how to approach her, she caught on to what I was asking for. I think I am feeling a bit more confident now. And she said she might have a suit that I could borrow if I do end up getting a date with Ms. Nguyen. I am trying not to think too hard on what a date would entail, but I am going to have to figure that out eventually. Probably on the way back to Gatarobi. But Koa did say Ms. Nguyen spends a fair amount of time at the shooting range, so maybe that is something we can bond over? We will see. And I will need to pay Koa back somehow for helping me out with this.</p> <p>About 9 hours after arriving on base, our LCs were good to go, and we received new orders. LSA comms were being interfered with by a VSAF installation. Ms. Nguyen prepared some data spikes that could hijack the array, but required close proximity. Cue Squad Lycaon. Kalak also came along, setting up a perimeter around the target site. Inside the site, there was a squad waiting for us. A couple Mirages, a Witch, an Ace, and a Demolisher. It was a long fought battle. Would have been much easier if we didn't need to have people stuck near the satellite towers. If we just needed me to be at one, that would work fine with my rifle. Had a lot of trouble with hacking from the Witch, but we were able to take it out quickly.</p> <p>Something I was not prepared for, was that the Demolisher had a pilot we knew. That fucking shitbag Broderick from yesterday. Somehow he went from piloting an MC for peaceful support to being a frontline heavy-hitter. Learning of our newly-found prisoner from yesterday, Ms. Nguyen gave us a new order. Broderick is not to leave this place alive. I have failed her before by not killing him. I will not make the same mistake twice. Specifically, Ms. Nguyen told us to teach him what happens when you fuck with the Crimson Wolves. Say no more, ma'am. But truthfully, it was rough. Jackal took some pretty heavy hits, but with some help from Achilles, we were able to turn the fight back into our favor. Jackal and Achilles did most of the damage to Broderick, while Odette and I cleaned up the others. After Broderick fell, and Squad Kalak had taken out a group of reinforcements on their way in, the last Mirage was able to escape. But that doesn't matter since we finished what we came here to do. Both things.</p> <p>After the Demolisher was disabled, Broderick was severely concussed and had some bleeding from the head. But he was still clinging to life. For the moment. I boosted over as quickly as I could, hopping out of the Muzzled Angel to make damn sure I see him die with my own eyes. And by my own hand. There is a lot to hate about my time at Makia Academy. But one thing is certain, the daggers they give their lancers are quite sharp. I made sure that there would be no chance that fucker lived.</p> <p>But alas, after getting the airwaves cleared, we are being rerouted to another combat zone. On our way there now, as we now have a track on the Union ambassador and the Del Rio's captain who went missing together.</p>"},{"location":"Bun%20Book/04%20-%20Leaving%20Cressidium/","title":"04   Leaving Cressidium","text":"<p>The Cressidium civil war is over. With the help of the Crimson Wolves, the Sovereignty was put on the back leg, allowing the LSA to control the capital. The Union ambassador is safe, and we have retrieved the captain of the Rio Grande. Word is already going around about the efforts of Squad Lycaon. We are being heralded as heroes. If that results in more rations for me, I\u2019ll gladly accept the title.</p> <p>After the transmission tower, we were picked up by dropships to be taken to our next objective. It was already a tough fight against Broderick, but we don\u2019t get a chance to rest. We were moved right on the next thing. Such is our lives as mercenaries, I suppose. The target looked at first sight to be a small warehouse in the shipping district outside the capital. But our orbital scans revealed that there is also an underground facility beneath the warehouse, with a port for airships sealed by blast doors. We were informed the Union ambassador and our ship captain were taken inside. Our instructions being to get inside, open up the blast doors, and secure the VIPs. The orbital scans were incomplete. We could only get a basic shape underground, without significant detail of the inside. We would also lose comms deeper in. So we started to plan our approach.</p> <p>We had decided to split into two groups. Achilles and Odette would use their LCs on the surface to create a diversion. Retrovertigo and Muzzled Angel, having COMP/CONs, were left with them. I had Angel covering the squad off-site with her rifle, while Retro was assigned to fire Hunter-Killers into a hole that Achilles would make in the blast door with her thermite. Meanwhile, Jackal and I went into the warehouse, to stealthily make our way to the security station and open the doors to let the mechs in. Achilles gave each of us a grenade to use as we see fit.</p> <p>Jackal and I took position at the front door of the warehouse while Achilles and Odette started to make noise. I was able to see Muzzled Angel get a shot off on one of the MCs that was patrolling the area. Shortly after, a wave of more MCs and some foot soldiers came out of the warehouse. As they ran past, I managed to trip one and take him out quietly. Jackal came over and\u2026I\u2019m not quite sure what happened, but after a few seconds, Jackal took on the appearance of the person I killed. Looked almost indistinguishable. He stole the soldier\u2019s uniform and datapad, and we headed inside. He gave me his camo cloth to keep myself hidden, so I put that on.</p> <p>At the security gate to the underground facility, Jackal started talking to the guard, impersonating the subject of his disguise. During the back-and-forth, it gave me an opening to sneak around and slit the guard\u2019s throat. Again, Jackal stole the guard\u2019s datapad. There was a call on the man\u2019s earpiece that they are bolstering their defense of the elevator. This gave us an idea. Jackal opened the elevator, put a grenade inside, then we sent it down to the bottom. As the elevator moved, he put on a pained voice and informed the enemies that people got past him and are headed down. After the grenade blew, though, a call was put out that the person Jackal was impersonating was compromised, and that they are going radio silent. If we took too long, they might be able to properly set up a defense, making our job much harder. I dove into the elevator shaft to reach the bottom as quickly as possible, using my jump pack to land safely. Jackal, who doesn\u2019t have a mobility hardsuit, opted to slide down the elevator cables. I opened the hatch on top of the elevator, and there were a couple survivors, but were all incapacitated. When Jackal reached me, he dropped into the elevator and started picking off the survivors with his rifle. Our assault can no longer be hidden, but I have not been seen. So I run ahead of Jackal further into the facility, eventually finding the security center. At some point during all of this, the MCs on the surface told their people to hire the merc, and not worry about how much they want for the job.</p> <p>There were a good six to eight soldiers inside. No way to do this quietly. When Jackal joined me, I cracked the door open and rolled a grenade inside. I braced myself against the wall with my submachine gun, and waited for the explosion. Things did not go as planned though\u2026 A soldier was able to get far enough from the grenade and dive out of the door, reflexively shooting at the first person he saw, Jackal, who was still disguised as one of them. When it happened, I\u2026I don\u2019t know what happened. Fear shot through my entire body. I panicked. I dropped my gun, and the next thing I remember, I was on the floor with Jackal trying to talk to me. The person who shot him was now dead with a bullet through the back of his head. I was breathing quickly and shaking. He told me not to worry, that he wasn\u2019t badly hurt. That he deserved it, given what he had done today. He said that he could not have made it this far without my help, and he needs me to keep going. Our objective is right in front of us. And our handler needs it done. I was able to get myself off the floor and push on.</p> <p>We got into the security station, and Jackal started whipping out cables from somewhere and connecting to the terminal. I could not really understand a lot that was showing on the screen, but I could make out that he got to a set of controls. Lights, doors, drones, turrets, and the hangar bay doors. First, he reestablished our long-range communications. It was wonderful to hear Ms. Nguyen\u2019s voice again. Jackal found some files that seemed interesting, and was ordered to send them over to Ms. Nguyen. She said that the files were encrypted, but it can be worried about later. She tells Jackal to try to get a higher level of clearance in the system, but after trying to do so, electricity sparked on his wires, and he seemed to be getting hurt. I was concerned, but I couldn't really do anything without risking getting shocked myself as well. He tried again, getting shocked another time. I could see him starting to not really hold it together anymore. But he changed his target. Rather than trying to get higher access, he went to at least get the hangar doors open. After a few seconds, I heard the latches open, but there was also some backlash from the system, locking Jackal out of the terminal.</p> <p>But we could at least continue with our mission. The doors were open, so we ran to the hangar, calling our mechs to come meet us. Retrovertigo leaped into the pit, landing in front of Jackal with its cockpit open. Muzzled Angel flew in from her lookout point, and I boosted myself up to hop into the seat. We were then joined by Heel Turn and White Swan, who had taken care of all the enemies on the surface. As light filled the hangar, we could see among the shipping containers, the ambassador and captain were being held by a submarine vehicle. Probably a dozen or so infantry and two MCs. I could see that one was equipped with a flamethrower, and another with arc whips. But before we could even react, Achilles ran in, and grabbed each of them one after the other, throwing them into the water. The infantry abandoned their position, dropping their weapons, and running away. Ms. Nguyen congratulated us on rescuing the VIPs and let us know that our exfil was on the way. I had readied my missiles to pick off the soldiers who were running, but Ms. Nguyen quickly changed her tone, yelling for all of us to get down.</p> <p>There was a blinding flash from above us, followed by a red beam traveling across the room, creating explosions as it went. Destroying shipping containers, breaking the concrete, blowing up some small aerial vehicles in the hangar. None of us were able to avoid it. After we gathered ourselves, a mech descended into the pit. An SSC MetalMark. It held a large gun in two arms, smoking. The one that just hit us. In its other 2 arms, it had a rifle and a sword. The pilot inside came on the radio. \u201cAnathema on site. Scratch what I said before. This one is free.\u201d She knew we were inside the enemy communications, calling us out as Crimson Wolves. Though she didn\u2019t seem to know exactly who we were. Her mech, Burning Miseries, booted up again, and prepared for combat.</p> <p>Achilles used Heel Turn to throw the mech into the water like the others, and dropped a smoke screen for the rest of us. But the enemy mech did not care, hovering above the water and shooting back at Heel Turn. The signal from Achilles went dark for a bit, so there was definitely some structural damage. Ms. Nguyen radioed us, informing us that while it isn\u2019t a surprise by now, the enemy is a lancer, like us. I fired a shot that I could swear was dead-on. But the mech moved out of the way just before impact, only getting glanced. She peered at me, saying \u201cYou\u2019ve never shot at a lancer before, have you child?\u201d She said \u201cI\u2019ve kept close tabs on Kalak. You aren\u2019t in black like Ligoni. I can see you, so you\u2019re not Arctos. Who are you, little Wolves?\u201d I thought I would get hit, but she turned her attention to Achilles and Odette, launching missiles at them before vanishing into a blue light. She appeared at the other side of the arena. Odette charged with White Swan, and gets a hit in, but Anathema somehow phased through White Swan and shot its leg joints from behind. Another signal disruption on Odette\u2019s end this time.</p> <p>After getting hit by Jackal, Anathema started charging her big gun again. I was able to get Retrovertigo to the ground, and dash into the smokescreen to take cover. The enemy let out another large beam around the hangar. More explosions, more debris. We kept up our offensive, until Anathema jumped back, firing a beam out of her smaller rifle. Both Odette and I were hit, and the assault rifle on one of my mounts just fucking disappeared. The weapon must be getting incredibly hot to be able to disintegrate metal that quickly. I\u2019ve only seen similar behavior once before, watching L1. But this was different.</p> <p>Retrovertigo was able to blast off the lance that Burning Miseries was two-handing. But then something bizarre happened. Some metallic\u2026things came out of the mech\u2019s chassis and attached to the lance, pulling it back up off the ground. This thing was regenerating. She grabbed at Achilles, shooting out more of those metal tendrils to use as claws, digging into Heel Turn\u2019s frame, crushing its chain axe, and shoving the lance through Heel Turn\u2019s midsection. Achilles just kept bashing into the cockpit of the enemy LC until a black liquid started pouring out. The light\u2019s on the mech\u2019s plating went from a linear red to pulsing brighter and brighter, eventually turning a bright purple. Retro warned us all that the Burning Miseries\u2019 core was overheating, and we need to evacuate. Anathema came on the radio again, choking out \u201cMark my words, little Wolves. This isn\u2019t over.\u201d I was the only one to react quickly enough to fly up out of the pit before the core detonated. The others were all damaged, but safe. There was more of those metallic tendrils everywhere in the hangar. But all of the metal and circuitry of the mech itself was vaporized in the blast.</p> <p>Ms. Nguyen told us that the dropships were approaching now that the threat was handled. As we were loading up, news must have hit that the Sovereignty\u2019s linchpin merc was dead. They started surrendering, allowing the LSA to retake the capital city. Squad Kalak was sent to deal with any remaining VSAF cells still fighting. But Squad Lycaon\u2019s work was done. We were told to withdraw to the Rio Grande. We are heading home soon.</p> <p>A little less than a week until we\u2019re back on Gatarobi. I will use this time to keep myself active. Training, eating, and definitely sleeping after this whole fiasco. It\u2019s only been two days on the surface, but it feels like it\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve been on this ship. Our licenses have been raised, so we can get access to new frames now. I have had the SSC Monarch in mind. I\u2019m sure Koa would be happy to see another Monarch in the hangar. I should go talk to her before we get back to base. Also Domenic. He seems quiet ever since the facility. I want to check on him. And also\u2026ask him to not mention my panic attack to anyone\u2026</p> <p>The staff brought up the Rainmaker head to my room on the ship, like I asked. I now realize that it is quite large, and it takes up a lot of space. It\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need my room for much more than sleeping anyway. When we get back to base, I\u2019ll find a good spot for it. I also have to unpack all my stuff too. Our personals weren\u2019t brought in before we got sent to Cressidium. All of my plushes are still in storage, as well as my hardsuit from the Striders.</p> <p>After we got back on the ship, I realized that I didn\u2019t have my gun with me. I must have forgotten to pick it back up after I calmed down. That is\u2026unfortunate. I\u2019ll have to tell Ms. Nguyen when we get back. Hopefully she won\u2019t be too upset about that. Speaking of her, I have decided that I\u2019m going to confess my feelings for her when we get to base and ask her out on a date. So that\u2019s something else I\u2019ll be preparing on the trip. Fuck, what do I say? I know Koa said to be confident in it, and I usually am confident with people, but why do I get nervous around Ms. Nguyen? Whatever I end up saying, I hope it goes over well.</p>"},{"location":"Bun%20Book/05%20-%20One%20Question%20Answered%2C%20Many%20More%20Formed/","title":"05   One Question Answered, Many More Formed","text":"<p>This has been an eventful few days, I would say. As thanks for rescuing the ambassador, we were given a basket of soaps, fresh fruit, and candles. I noticed on the trip back to Gatarobi that the people were a lot more responsive to us in Squad Lycaon. Unlike before where we were mostly ignored, now people are talking to us. There are still some that will move out of our way, but they do so with a smile or some other form of acknowledgement. They all witnessed our work on Cressidium, they heard that we are the ones responsible for rescuing the Union ambassador, and the captain of the Rio Grande. This feels similar to how I am familiar with. People not being friendly, per se. But respectful. Recognizing the position of the people walking past them.</p> <p>When we got back to Gatarobi, there was a crowd gathered in the hangar. We went out after getting our clearance to disembark, and the crowd began to cheer when they saw Lycaon and Kalak. Admittedly, it was a strange feeling. I had been doing work like this for years, but I had never been praised for my performance. It was simply a job. One I was expected to do. I would get back from a job, and go right back to training without a word. This is not to say that I dislike the treatment, though. It was nice that people were actually recognizing our efforts.</p> <p>We are led through the base by Ms. Nguyen, going through the atrium where more people welcome us back. Until we get to our suite. When we get inside, there are packs of fresh bread, tomatoes, and cheese on the kitchen counter. Ms. Nguyen told us to make ourselves at home and get some rest, as she started to cook. She made grilled cheese and tomato soup for us. It was delicious. Much better than the nutrition bars we have been eating for the past couple weeks we\u2019ve been away. As the food was ready, Ms. Nguyen sat with us at the table. She began talking about things going forward. That we would have some time for training. But apart from that, and sticking to our diet and workouts, we are free to use our time as we see fit. Though we were warned to try not to kill anyone if we end up in the bar.</p> <p>I decided since she is here and talking to us, that I would go about asking Ms. Nguyen on a date. I began by telling her that I was grateful for her support during our mission. And then went on to say that I think she is nice and pretty. Then I actually asked if she wanted to go on a date. I was so nervous when she put her spoon down and just looked at me for a few moments, blinking. But she did accept my offer. We decided to go to the shooting range tomorrow. I am excited, but also a bit scared. I will need to get in touch with Ms. Palmer to see if she can make good on the suit she offered. Definitely not going on a first date with just my hoodie and shorts.</p> <p>I took some time to get my room set up, given how we didn\u2019t have a chance to before being shipped off to Cressidium. Domenic had gone off with Gil for something. I wanted to talk to him about our\u2026hardships in the Sovereignty facility. So I had to wait for him to come back. When he did, I tried beckoning him over, but got ignored. I took Chili off of my bed and threw him at Dom to get his attention. He did not seem very pleased by that. But he did finally acknowledge me. I tried to open up that I wanted to talk about what happened, and he seemed pretty upset at my mention. I wanted to respect his feelings, but I needed to get this out. I asked for his secrecy regarding my panic attack, and he agreed in return for my secrecy about his. I did have to remind him that I wasn\u2019t the only who heard it, though. When he cleared the radio interference, Ms. Nguyen also heard the last bit of his panic. I would keep the secret, but if someone else mentioned it, I was not the one who told them. I assured Dom that I would be there and supportive of him. As both a teammate and hopefully a friend. I would do the same for anyone else of Lycaon. And I hope that they would do the same for me.</p> <p>Later in the night, Gil brought some large kegs into the common area of our suite. She seemed pretty averse to us requesting specific music to be played. And despite having the capability of making the lights in the suite any color or intensity that we want, Gil kept them at just their normal color. If this is supposed to be a party, it is going to be the most bland party ever. And I should know. At least at Makia, we were at least allowed to request a certain lighting in the barracks for a little while.\u00a0</p> <p>The first person to come over for this party was Ms. Palmer, looking as cool as she usually does. She had her two squamates, Citra and Bulan, with her. Although which one was which, I would not have been able to tell you. I requested some cups, so that we wouldn't be limited to drinking from these kegs; one of the twins, who I later learned was Citra, helped me find the cups that are included with our suite. Gil and Koa immediately go into party mode, with Gil doing a handstand on the keg and drinking while Koa held Gil's legs up. Shortly after, we got visited by Squad Ligoni. They all seemed very well-dressed. Leading them was Tsar, who just so happens to be Apex-07. The Wolves must have some serious backing if they are able to pay contracts for two different members of Apex-10. He seems nice enough at least. Each member of Ligoni brought some drinks for the party, including a bottle from Duke that Ligoni called \"coolant\". </p> <p>Seeing all of the drinks that have piled up on the counter, I decided to try something. I picked up a bottle of vodka, and poured some in a glass, drinking it. It burned...so so bad. The drink itself wasn't too bad. But the burn of the alcohol in it tasted like fire. It made my head a little light after a few seconds. I had the brilliant thought that I should take another drink. Maybe the second time won't be as bad? I was partially right. Felt right enough for a little more. But after the combined burn in my throat of three drinks, I figured it was time to take a break. If only I knew what was coming... </p> <p>Ms. Palmer was arm-wrestling one of Ligoni (I think it was Duke, but I am not super familiar with them) for quite a while before she eventually won. She called me over. Maybe to watch? Maybe to talk? But for some reason I figured this would be a good time to challenge her again. I was barely in control as I put my elbow down on the table, challenging Ms. Palmer to an arm wrestle. Before I even knew it, I had lost. I didn't even hear Duke say \"go\" before my arm was flat on the table. Koa gave me a cup, and told me to keep drinking, and that she would give me more later. It didn't taste the same as the vodka from before, but it kept my mind busy while I sat to the side for a while. </p> <p>At one point, I started dancing in the room with some others. The world was spinning, but it felt good to be dancing and singing with others. But even though I was surrounded by people, I couldn't help but feel slightly lonely. I guess I was hoping that Ms. Nguyen would have showed up. I sent her a message, asking if she would come at least show her face. I then ended up getting distracted and kept dancing. I was with Duke and Koa singing something, but then I got really tired out of nowhere. I was told later on that I passed out.</p> <p>I woke up in Ms. Nguyen's office. Apparently, after I had messaged her, I forgot to respond after she said she would not be available to visit, so she asked if I was okay. After I passed out, Koa used my datapad to text her, and was instructed to bring me to Ms. Nguyen's office. I was on the couch, with a blanket over me. That's...embarassing...</p> <p>She left some vitamins and a drink on the table for me to try to treat the lingering effects of the alcohol. We spoke for a little bit until I was able to sit myself up. Ms. Nguyen came over with a cloth. She put her finger to my chin and said a single word: \"Up.\" Without even thinking, I tilted my head up. Oh boy... Never going to live that down, am I? I do not even know why I followed her order so unconsciously. Am I that eager to follow her? To serve her? I will definitely have to think about that some more. She used the cloth to wipe off some marker that someone drew on my face after I passed out. Ms. Nguyen told me to rest more if I needed to while she works, but I figured I should stop inconveniencing her. I went to leave, and we confirmed together that she still wants to go on our date. That was a relief, as I didn't know if she would still want to after that cloth.</p> <p>Today was\u2026something. I\u2019m not really sure what to think of it. I was woken up this morning by a message from Koa, saying she was at my door. When I opened up, she immediately said that she thinks she promised me a suit. Well, that saves me the trouble of having to track her down. But how did she know I needed it? Either way, we started to head to the atrium. We spoke about how Lycaon\u2019s mission went, and how my asking out of Ms. Nguyen went. She agreed that the shooting range would be a good idea, since she knows Ms. Nguyen was a competitive shooter. We got to where Koa was leading us, a person who has made suits for her, and she says does good work. I was fitted, and we discussed designs for a bit, before the suit was made in the nearby fab for me. I also requested a suit for Samantha. Koa was apprehensive at first, but then told the designer to do it.</p> <p>After that was done, Koa came to straighten up the suit, making sure it looked nice, before she said she had some advice to give me as far as dating goes. Quite welcome, as I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. Most of it was things I had read about before. Try to make the time about them, pursue their interests and ask questions about it, try to find out more about the person. She mentioned that it is a bit different, given that I am going on a date with my boss. She gave me another piece of advice, saying that especially since I am going on a date with my boss, to not make the first move as far as a kiss goes. Went on to say that the right advice is actually to not date your boss. Though, as she said, \u201cBut glass houses, you know?\u201d</p> <p>I made my way back to my room, and started getting ready close to 3PM. As if by clockwork, Ms. Nguyen knocked on my door exactly at 3. I took a moment to look myself in the mirror before answering. She looked at me for a bit, before commenting that my suit looked very nice, and that Samantha looked good too. My heart started beating really quickly when she said that. I should keep an eye on that if it happens in the future. We started to make our way to the shooting range. Ms. Nguyen said that she had arranged for two of her sporting pistols to be brought to the range, since she noticed that my gun was not listed on the intake manifest. Honestly, I was hoping no one would notice I lost my gun\u2026</p> <p>The range was relatively empty today. I took a look at the scoreboard, where Koa was far and away the top score. There were also several members of Ligoni. Ms. Nguyen unveiled the pistols she had brought out. Very nicely made, custom-fitted, streamlined competition pistols fitted for her specifically. So she was definitely not just a hobbyist. As she is doing her pre-checks on the guns, she asked how much experience I\u2019ve had at ranges. Well, I mean, I\u2019ve been handling firearms since I was a child. I\u2019m certainly familiar with their use, though I am not the greatest. I am much more versed in mechanized combat over EVA. She asked something about Makia\u2026I don\u2019t remember the question she asked. I kind of zoned out when it was mentioned. She noticed that her question made me uncomfortable, and apologized for it, before trying to change the subject. I asked what got her into shooting, to which she explained that she was part of NDAP, under Union. She was in an officer academy, and when she left, wanted to keep herself occupied with something she was familiar with.</p> <p>She offered me the first round on the targets. As I did my own checks on the gun she lent me, we spoke briefly about why I chose not to just get myself out of this life when I had the chance. It\u2019s quite simple really. Being a pilot is what I was raised for. How can I regret or walk away from the only life I\u2019ve ever known?</p> <p>Anyway, I hadn\u2019t had much experience with Lancer-difficulty target shooting. The targets were a bit hard to track, moving very erratically. But after taking a moment to watch them, I started my round. I was hitting my shots but not hitting the center. The gun felt really nice in my hand though. Very comfortable, even if not made for me. And the recoil was almost nonexistent. After I finished my set, Ms. Nguyen said I did a wonderful job, and she is impressed by how fast I was. I actually thought I was rather slow, but if she says I\u2019m fast, I will take it. She uploaded my score to the leaderboard and I was ranked 25th. Maybe higher than I was expecting for first time. But not as high as I want to be. I\u2019ll need to practice more. To be fair, I have not been to a range since before my augments.</p> <p>As Ms. Nguyen got ready for her set, she asked if I had ever watched a movie before, noting that she hopes it doesn\u2019t sound insensitive. I have seen instructional movies before, but entertainment-based movies were not something we really had. She took her pistol, and she started her set. I noticed that the soft look she had on her face had disappeared, and she was completely stone-faced. She began shooting at the targets, starting as fast as I was, but getting faster. She very quickly passed my score, and still had a lot of shots left.</p> <p>But something happened. Ms. Nguyen let out a yell. I heard her last round ricochet after she yelled, and she dropped her gun. I was counting the shots, and she still had a few left. But she was sitting on the ground clutching her arm. As I got closer, I could see that the muscles in her arm were extremely tense, and her arm was locked up and shaking. I could also see sweat beading on her forehead, and there was a bit of blood showing in her eye. She told me to reach into her breast pocket, where I found an injector of some sort. She pulled her hair to the side and bent her head down, telling me to inject it. But I was not ready to see that she has a Kerub port on the back of her neck. I did as I was told and injected the thing into her neck. I could tell from the way she moved in response that it was very painful. She took a few moments to collect her breath, and she stood up.</p> <p>She tried to dismiss my concern. Saying that she \u201cJust got carried away. That\u2019s all.\u201d She flexed her hand for a moment before pressing the end set button on the terminal, resetting the targets. She apologized to me, saying she had to go. I want to understand. I want to know what happened. But she hurried away pretty quickly, telling me to just leave the guns on the table and someone would get them. She also mentioned that maybe we could watch a movie together next time. So silver lining, I guess, that she wants to do something together again.</p> <p>I left the guns on the table, then went back to my room. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone yet, just went straight into my room and closed the door so I could write in peace. I have a lot to think about. Why does Ms. Nguyen have a Kerub port? Why is she being so secretive about it after showing it? Was she a Lancer? Did she have an unsuccessful augmentation, leaving her unable to pilot anymore? I had no idea she was a pilot! What even happened to her arm? And what was in that injector to stop it? This definitely wasn\u2019t the first time, if she has that thing ready at a moment\u2019s notice. I obviously won\u2019t be telling anyone about this. But I will definitely be asking her about it again. I cannot make her tell me, nor will I try to coerce an answer out of her. Simply ask, and if she doesn\u2019t say, she doesn\u2019t say. But trust goes both ways. There is nothing wrong with people having their secrets. I have mine. But if we are going to be doing more things together and getting closer, I would hope that she can at least be honest with me. Instead of just trying to dismiss a very existent issue as \u201cgetting carried away.\"</p> <p>On a less\u2026tense note\u2026I am very happy that she agreed to go out today. And despite the abrupt and unsatisfying ending to our date, I do look forward to doing it again, and trying out a movie. Ms. Palmer says that Gatarobi has had a bit of a \u201ccreature feature\u201d kick going. Whatever that means. I wonder if I should get her something. I\u2019ll have to ask like\u2026what people enjoy receiving.</p>"},{"location":"Bun%20Book/06%20-%20Muzzled%20Angel%202.0/","title":"06   Muzzled Angel 2.0","text":"<p>The day after my date with Ms. Nguyen, Ms. Palmer greeted me early in the morning by buzzing my door. She tried to ask how the suit fit for my date, but it was clear her mind was elsewhere. She put an arm around my shoulder and said that she had something cool to show me. We walked to the hangar, where there was a very tall blanketed figure. With the past few days, I had completely forgotten about the process of my new frame. We were met by a person only a little taller than myself, named Shoichiro Blake. She is a representative from SSC. They are accompanying the new mech frame, and I assume they handle all the paperwork with the administration. Shoichiro was very excitable, having expected the application to be rejected due to the exclusivity of Monarchs. But after Ms. Palmer sent a recommendation for me, they approved the construction of Muzzled Angel. </p> <p>Shoichiro said it was very interesting to see a Monarch being used as a marksman platform. She isn't wrong. The Monarch is designed to fill a mobile artillery role, firing a completely inordinate amount of missiles. Bold of them to think I can't merge the two styles. Shoichiro directed our attention towards the blanketed figure, where a person was coming down in the maintenance platform elevator. In my opinion, a stunningly beautiful person, with shoulder-length black hair, swept over one eye. Glasses accenting their face quite well, a nose ring, but a bit of a scary looking expression. Shoichiro introduced us to the person, Marissa Faulkner, as my mechanic and the designer of Muzzled Angel's Monarch frame. They spared all pleasantries in meeting, not even waiting for me to introduce myself before they asked if I was the one piloting their baby. Does...this mean we are co-parents? </p> <p>They press a button to remove the blanket, revealing my new Muzzled Angel. We take a walkaround, going to the different stops of the maintenance platform to discuss the specifications. Everything is as I requested, even repurposing the anti-material rifle from my Everest frame. I am definitely interested in seeing the artillery capabilities of a Monarch for myself. Misc. Faulkner spoke out to Muzzled Angel, the lights around the frame activating as she responded. The NHP is basic at the moment, but can be iterated on over time. There is a bit of personality at least; she can be a good companion in the field. Angel said it was good to see me again, though that this is more of a new beginning than a reunion. </p> <p>I got into the cockpit at Misc. Faulkner's request so we could step through diagnostics and maintenance checklists. They were very intrigued by the request for a sniper-oriented Monarch, and even got a special exception granted by SSC to build an eleventh Monarch before leaving their position as designer. Before we started our checks, they asked to confirm if I went to Makia Academy. I really don't like being asked about it, but I get it. Each lancer program differs slightly, and the protocols in our augments are not the same. Faulkner says they were able to crack it, but that it was difficult to do so. </p> <p>Everyone else got their new mech frames as well. An SSC Mounring Cloak for Odette, a IPS-N Blackbeard for Achilles, and a very strange frame for Jackal, which his mechanic said is a HORUS Minotaur. That thing is...freaky.</p> <p>Domenic and Bethany got Lycaon together in our suite to discuss some information they had each found while researching various topics. Searching for the lancer we fought, Anathema, did not have any meaningful results. But there was some looking into Gil's lancer program, the Reconciliation Project. There are some traces of the name connected to some HORUS files in the Crimson Wolves archives. They were looking into \"improved integration\", but the contract was terminated. Nothing else is shown in the file except a spot for last known coordinates for a server. But the field was blank.</p> <p>Domenic also told us some things he found looking into Ms. Nguyen. She is keeping psychological profiles on us. Looking into the things we like, dislike, findings on gaining and maintaining our trust. It is a little strange, but I guess I get it. Finding the most effective way to lead us, most likely? But Dom also found some other notes for each of us. For me, he found a file listing a lot of financial and transactional data from a paramilitary corporation. There was also a list of names. He was not able to glean anything from the list other than that they all had connections to me. These records are definitely from the Fearless Striders. No one else it could be. Dom believes Ms. Nguyen is searching for something in here...but what?</p> <p>I met with Ms. Nguyen a few days later. I am still thinking and trying to process that data from the Striders. I am not yet ready to talk to her about it. But I definitely wanted to talk with her about the incident during our date. Definitely not normal for someone's arm to lock up and they double over in pain. Then you realize they have a Kerub port in their neck. Ms. Nguyen welcomed me into her office and offered me some tea, which I accepted. We tried some small talk for a little while, but the questions were burning in my mind, so I came out and asked her directly about what happened. </p> <p>She again tried to say that she was fine and got carried away. But after a moment, she decided to be more honest about it. As she previously stated, she was in a Union officer academy for intelligence operations. She had a promising career, and was selected to become a lancer. But something went wrong, and her augments didn't take. She is no longer able to pilot. Exerting herself physically or relying on her augments makes them act up. But even more than that, trying to pilot an LC would kill her. She left Union, and went to manage MC squads with the Wolves until she was granted the rank of handler for when Squad Lycaon was being formed. </p> <p>She apologized for running away. She said she didn't want her shortcomings to get in the way of what we are building together. I do not see it as a shortcoming. If she had not exerted herself so hard, I would not have known she had augments at all. But it doesn't matter to me if she is augmented or not. I still really like her, and I want to spend time with her, and I want to be the best lancer I can be for her. She said she had a meeting coming up, and had to wrap up. But she said that she would like to try cooking something with me for our next date. She asked if there were any foods I really like. I have liked pretty much every food I have eaten. But I do have a list of food that I have heard of and haven't had a chance to try. She suggests picking one to try cooking together. Although I kinda want to ask her if there's anything she would like to make. I want to make this next date about her. </p> <p>As I was leaving her office, I also asked if we could maybe see a movie if there is time, to which she agreed. I want to get her a gift. Something to let her know that I do not see her faulty augments as a shortcoming of her. To let her know that I respect the hell out of her as a handler, and also be a bit personal to show that I really like her. </p> <p>Today, we were called by Ms. Nguyen to the sim room. Our mechanics were already in the room, and we were brought up the control area. Squad Ligoni's handler, Elizabeth Sharp, was there. Gil had made some bad choices interacting with her before, calling Ligoni's training into question. So Sharp has challenged Squad Lycaon. We are to create a battlefield in the simulator for Ligoni, then we will fight them in it. I cannot express how bad of an idea this is. We are four brand new lancers. Ligoni has five lancers that have been working together for several years, as well as an Apex-10 member. We are so boned. But Ms. Nguyen seems excited at the opportunity to watch us fight them. </p>"},{"location":"Characters/Crimson%20Wolves/Amaq/","title":"Amaq","text":"<p>Affiliation: Crimson WolvesRole: Unknown</p> <p>While their handler was held up in an unexpected meeting, Amaq approached the newly arrived Squad Lycaon and offered to help the fledgling lancer group find their way around Gatarobi Station.</p> <p>After seemingly vanishing upon the arrival of Handler Nguyen, Amaq was later confirmed to be within the Crimson Wolves' records, albeit with heavy file access restrictions which the handler was not privy to.

Heel Turn takes structure damage and is stunned until the next turn.</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seline comes on the radio \u201cLycaon, this won\u2019t come as a surprise, but this is an enemy lancer!\u201d</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anathema, after Bunny shoots at them. \u201cYou\u2019ve never shot at a lancer before, have you child?\u201d</p> <p>o\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve kept tabs on Kalak.

Crates explode, debris is flying everywhere. We do not take damage, as we are all either prone or in cover. The rifle enters a 3-round cooldown.</p> <p>o\u00a0\u00a0 Seline tells us Anathema is a new lancer working freelance. Uses a SSC Metalmark</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Achilles rushes and grapples Anathema, but takes damage from overwatch.</p> <p>o\u00a0\u00a0 While grappled, Anathema starts swinging at Achilles with her sword twice. Taking 8 damage.</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bunny locks into place, steadying her aim, and shooting the AMR at Anathema. She takes another structure damage, but it is only a glancing blow.</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anathema phases back. Odette and Bunny take massive damage.

She yells out \u201cAHHHHH!\u201d The chassis buckles outwards.</p> <p>o\u00a0\u00a0 A mass of sinew comes out of the mech with metal plates, pulling up the lance. The chassis fractals out and makes new arm structures to hold the lance.</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anathema teleports forward at Heel Turn, sinew blasting out at her. The chassis fractal turns into claws. She grabs onto Heel Turn\u2019s axe, squeezing it to make it creak and groan. She holds the lance to Heel Turn\u2019s midsection. Heel Turn takes 6 damage and structure damage.</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Achilles repeatedly cuts into the cockpit of Burning Miseries. There is a black bloody liquid pouring out of the mech. Tendrils reach out at Heel Turn. The lights on the plating turn bright red, brighter and brighter. They turn purple.</p> <p>o\u00a0\u00a0 Retrovertigo tells Dom \u201cWarning: Core Overload detected.
