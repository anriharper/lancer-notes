·        Swept up on dropships towards next objective

o   Ambassador in small warehouse

o   Underground facility under the warehouse

o   Airship port in center of facility

·        EVA Drop into facility, access the port, and drop mechs in

·        Facility scan uploaded to datapads

·        Will lose contact as we get deeper in

·        Seline called Bunny good girl for stabbing the shit out of Broderick (+1 accuracy to one roll)

·        Got command die from Achilles for a stealth kill and a frag grenade

**LOUD TEAM**

·        Muzzled Angel set to cover the squad from a distance

o   A few MCs patrolling

o   Achilles and Odette immediately tear through one.

o   The enemy cry out on radio “Contact! They’re lancers!”

·        Muzzled Angel shoots an AMR round through an MC, turning the pilot into a red mist.

·        Angel shoots another AMR round, but misses the target.

·        After Heel Turn grappled and threw an MC at another, White Swan skewered both with a spear, destroying them.

o   Angel is using her jumpjets to avoid gunfire.

·        Heel Turn tears through a MC with their chain-axe, and uses the body as a brace to shoot at others with the HMG

o   Achilles ejects, feeling invincible, to start going towards the blast door to plant the thermite charge.

o   An MC levels their gun to Achilles, but Angel blows the head off with her rifle.

**STEALTH TEAM**

·        As reinforcements come, Bunny trips a footsoldier, stabbing him in the back of the neck.

o   Jackal steals the soldier’s (Hensley) identity. Stealing his outfit, face, and hair. As well as his datapad.

·        Jackal talks to the security captain in the warehouse, while Bunny sneaks behind him and slits his throat.

o   There is a call on the captain’s earpiece that they are bolstering their defense of the elevator

o   Broderick’s last name is Beauregard

·        Jackal puts a grenade in the elevator, sending it down, calling ahead that the enemies are headed down the shaft.

·        Jackal sends the elevator down and the grenade blows. “Rodriguez is compromised! We lost elevator access!”

o   Jackal slides down the elevator cables, while Bunny dives to the bottom and boosts her jump pack before hitting the bottom of the shaft to land safely.

o   Enemies are going radio silent, so we decide to increase our aggression. Jackal opens up the hatch of the elevator and picks off the survivors from the grenade with his laser rifle. Bunny stays in stealth mode, running further into the facility.

·        In the facility, Bunny and Jackal head to the security center.

o   Bunny cracks the door open, rolling a frag grenade inside, then readies herself with her SMG.

o   A person jumps out from the explosion and shoots Jackal. The enemy gunshots send Bunny into a panic.

§  Bunny drops her gun and recoils back into the wall.

o   Jackal takes care of the survivor, and comes to try to calm Bunny down.

§  Jackal remembers that Bunny is very mission-oriented. And that despite her lack of experience in EVA, she had been doing a good job.

§  “Look, I know ok? But listen, you’ve taken down what 6 fucking people now? And not a single one has seen you. I don’t even fucking know where you are. Honestly it didn’t even hurt. I’m fine. I’ve done a lot of fucked up things today, so maybe I deserved that to be honest. Don’t feel bad. The point is, the finish is right in this room. We’re almost done. Let’s get in there and open that blast door. You know who will be happy when we get this done? Seline. I think this might even be deserving of a grilled cheese. I think you’ve earned it. I would not have made it down to this room without you here with me.”

§  Bunny calms down during Jackal’s talk, and is ready to go on. However, she did not pick up her SMG that she dropped.

·        Inside the security center, Jackal brings out his cables and jacks into the terminal. He runs a set of passwords, eventually getting the right code. Has access to lights, doors, security, drones, turrets. Finds bay doors controls.

o   Jackal downloads a bunch of personnel files, and reestablishes long-range comms  to reach Seline. He sends the files to Seline for later.

o   Jackal fails to get higher access and gets zapped by the ICE. Bunny looks worried but holds trust in him. Jackal fails again and is zapped again. He feels lightheaded.

o   Jackal changes targets to the blast doors, as he is running out of strength. He is able to get the doors to open, but gets locked out of the system.

§  The doors open up, an MC falls into the gap and falls down into the hangar.

**TEAMS REUNITE**

·        Jackal and Bunny call our mechs to us. Retrovertigo does a superhero landing and opens the cockpit. Muzzled Angel flies into the hangar. Bunny runs up to the Angel and uses her jump pack to boost herself into the cockpit.

·        Inside the hangar, there are a bunch of cargo containers. There is a submarine, and there are soldiers surrounding the submarine, guarding the ambassador and ship captain. There is a pair of mechs as well.

o   One mech has a large canister on its back and a long weapon with a pilot light at the end. The other has electric whips on the ends of its arms.

·        We sound off and initiate combat with the enemies before us.

·        Achilles instantly throws the two MCs into the water of the submarine. The soldiers drop their weapons and flee, leaving the ambassador and captain behind.

·        Seline tells us dropships are on the way, but cuts off by yelling “GET DOWN!”

·        There is a flash of light above and a beam of red crashing down. The beam travels across the room, creating explosions across the room. All of our mechs are thrown back and take structure damage.

·        A mech comes down into the hangar. It is streamlined, sleek, modern. 4 arms. two of the arms are holding an enormous gun with smoke. the others are holding a rifle and sword.

o   “Anathema on site. Scratch what I said before. This one is free.”

o   Lights run in stripe patterns down its chassis. Smoke from flight system rising up.

o   “They’ve been hacking your comms anyway. Isn’t that right, Wolves?”

o   The mech leans forward, “Burning Miseries, let’s get to work.”

**BOSS START**

·        Achilles grapples Anathema into the water, then drops a smoke charge to cover us.

o   After getting knocked into the water, Anathema turns to shoot a plasma rifle at Heel Turn. Heel Turn takes structure damage and is stunned until the next turn.

·        Seline comes on the radio “Lycaon, this won’t come as a surprise, but this is an enemy lancer!”

·        Anathema, after Bunny shoots at them. “You’ve never shot at a lancer before, have you child?”

o   “I’ve kept tabs on Kalak. You aren’t in black like Ligoni. I see you, so you aren’t Arctos. Who are you, little wolves?”

·        The mech shoots missiles at Heel Turn and White Swan, then vanishes into a blue light, flying over to the other side of the arena.

o   White Swan lunges with the charge blade, catching its side as it tries to dodge, and retaliates with overwatch. Swan is able to duck under the sword.

o   The mech phases through Swan and shoots into its leg joint. Odette is jammed as static goes across her screens.

·        Jackal tries to talk to Anathema. They respond it is easier to put us to the sword while we’re young (MILF alert)

o   Jackal opens up with HMG fire. Deals 10 damage.

·        Burning Miseries charges the Volley module.

·        Muzzled Angel rams Retrovertigo to the ground, then dashes into the smoke to take cover and reload.

o   Plasma rains through the hangar. Crates explode, debris is flying everywhere. We do not take damage, as we are all either prone or in cover. The rifle enters a 3-round cooldown.

o   Seline tells us Anathema is a new lancer working freelance. Uses a SSC Metalmark

·        Achilles rushes and grapples Anathema, but takes damage from overwatch.

o   While grappled, Anathema starts swinging at Achilles with her sword twice. Taking 8 damage.

·        Bunny locks into place, steadying her aim, and shooting the AMR at Anathema. She takes another structure damage, but it is only a glancing blow.

·        Anathema phases back. Odette and Bunny take massive damage. Muzzled Angel takes structure damage, and her assault rifle is vaporized.

·        Retrovertigo gets a massive volley off with the HMG, blasting the lance off of Burning Miseries. She yells out “AHHHHH!” The chassis buckles outwards.

o   A mass of sinew comes out of the mech with metal plates, pulling up the lance. The chassis fractals out and makes new arm structures to hold the lance.

·        Anathema teleports forward at Heel Turn, sinew blasting out at her. The chassis fractal turns into claws. She grabs onto Heel Turn’s axe, squeezing it to make it creak and groan. She holds the lance to Heel Turn’s midsection. Heel Turn takes 6 damage and structure damage.

·        Achilles repeatedly cuts into the cockpit of Burning Miseries. There is a black bloody liquid pouring out of the mech. Tendrils reach out at Heel Turn. The lights on the plating turn bright red, brighter and brighter. They turn purple.

o   Retrovertigo tells Dom “Warning: Core Overload detected. Retreat to safe distance.” The light is blinding.

o   “Mark my words, little wolves. This isn’t over!”

o   Muzzled Angel quickly boosts out of the hangar. The others take 8 energy damage from the explosion as purple sinew explodes everywhere.

·        Bunny calls Seline to report that the lancer is dead. Dropships incoming.

o   As we gather ourselves, we see meat raining down around us. All metal of the mech was completely vaporized.

·        After Anathema fell, the rest of the Vestans stand down.

o   Pending rewards.

o   Gain license level.

·        LSA reinforcements push Sovereignty forces out of the capital city. Squad Kalak is deployed to mop up remaining cells.

o   The war is over.

o   Our part here is done. All Crimson Wolves are withdrawn to exfil to Rio Grande.
