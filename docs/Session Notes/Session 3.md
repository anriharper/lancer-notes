- Arrive at FOB Sabre. Gecko and Starchild have left the Crimson Wolves and were on the first transport off of Cressidium.
- As supplement, Gil, callsign Achilles, joined the squad. Seline also granted us a small (relative to our LCs) drone that she could control from the Rio Grande. 
- Our LCs were handed off to the engineers to be repaired and outfitted with some new toys allowed to us by our new license level.
- We were given 9 hours of downtime. 
- Bunny asked Koa how to ask out Seline. Got some advice. She may have a suit that will fit if Bunny scores a date.

- New mission objective came in when our downtime was done. We were to secure and augment a transmission tower that is interfering with Crimson Wolf and LSA comms.
	- Have to hijack the jammer for ourselves. 
	- Importantly, the target was not to be destroyed.
- Enemy resistance on target site was heavy. Squad Kalak maintained a perimeter to hold off reinforcements, but Lycaon was alone on the inside. 
- An enemy Demolisher turned out to have Broderick as a pilot. 
	- New orders from Seline: Broderick was not to leave the target site alive.
- After a difficult fight, Broderick's mech was disabled. Bunny came over, and repeatedly stabbed Broderick to make sure that he was dead. 

- The captain of the Rio Grande, as well as the Union ambassador, had been found at a warehouse facility controlled by the Sovereignty.
