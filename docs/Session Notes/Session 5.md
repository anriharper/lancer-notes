·      Conflict in Cressidium comes to an abrupt end after Squad Kalak broke into the city center, destroying the frontlines of the sovereignty.

·      Ambassador thanked Lycaon for saving them. When boarding the ship, we are given a basket of nice soap and fresh fruit and candles.

o   Union ambassador has shoulder length hair pulled back in a bun, piercings, clean cut beard, wearing a nice purple sari.

·      Seline is beaming when we return to the ship with the good news. When we get back to FOB Sabre, we are listening to radio reports of the conflict in its final stages. In the next few days, we get to rest and relax.

·      Kalak is praised for their efforts into the city. Thanks are passed along from the Union officials in Cradle for our rescuing the ambassador, and the part we played in accelerating the talks of pulling Cressidium into Union.

·      We get to spend a few days actually running drills, as we were supposed to. We are basically on retainer for a bit, but Union forces have arrived for the main work.

·      Cressidium is not very far (relatively) from Gatarobi, so it does not take too much time to get back to base.

·      We realize that the people on the ship are much more responsive to us now. We are not treated as civilians on this military ship anymore. They recognize us and are more friendly. Some people are avoidant, but out of respect for the Lancers. We feel more welcome here.

·        When we arrive back at Gatarobi Station, everyone is preparing for the arrivals from Cressidium. Seline meets us at the hangar. We notice the crowd watching for the new lancers to disembark, then they cheer and clap as they see us.

o   Bunny reacts to the praise with shock. She has never been applauded for her work.

·        We cross through the main hub of Gatarobi, with its atrium view of most of the main amenities of the station. The traffic gets thinner as we are brought deeper into the station. We get onto a lift that Seline opens with a keycard, taking us to the Lancer suites.

·        On the kitchen island in our lancer suite, there are bags of bread, fresh tomatoes, and cheese.

o   Seline tells us to make ourselves at home, and get some rest, as she starts to make roasted tomato soup and grilled cheese.

·        Seline comes to sit with us, talking about diet plans and workout plans she is building for us, etc.

o   These are the times I need you, this is what you need to do. Apart from that, your time is yours.

o   Try not to kill anyone at the bar.

o   During this, Bunny asks her out. The squad is stunned, trying to ignore what just happened.

o   Seline sets down her spoon and blinks. “Uh…ok…Um…Let me think…I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t love the chance to get to know each of you better.  What did you have in mind?”

o   Bunny suggests the shooting range, to which Seline agrees to do 3pm the next day, saying she will block out a couple hours in her day. And to let her know if there’s anything else Bunny would like to do other than shoot.

### Gil

·        Wolfing down her grilled cheese, and says that she will go get some drinks and go to the other lancer squads to start a party.

·        Seline receives the requisition request on her tablet and says she’ll do what she can.

·        Dom follows Gil to going around the different lancer suites.

·        Achilles goes to Kalak’s suite, and Koa answers. Her jacket is on, and she’s wearing comfortable wear. Asks how she can help Gil.

o   Gil tells her about the party. Koa asks if they are the first room Gil went to, because she’s a bit busy. Says she will see about tonight, but her handler usually has longer “debriefs”.

o   “Arctos will not answer the door. I don’t think Ligoni will take you up on the offer.”

o   Gil is a bit disappointed in how not-chill Koa is, having to check with her handler.

·        Gil goes to Squad Arctos’ suite. The receptionist says they are not in, and what is needed.

o   Shuts down Gil, saying they have no way of knowing where Arctos is.

·        Gil now goes to the sim rooms, where Squad Ligoni is training.

o   They are in the sim pods. Someone on the observation deck is speaking to the pilots by microphone.

o   Gil walks in, and gets a few double takes.

o   Someone runs up “Sorry, I don’t think Lycaon is on the roster today.”

o   Gil wants to get in the simulation, despite the protest of this being a closed session.

§  Gil tries to push past to get into an open pod.

o   The person on the mic presses their intercom button and says “You! Lycaon! What are you doing here?”

o   The person who came up is stammering and shrinking away a bit.

o   The woman says “Fuck. Suspend. Again, Lycaon! What are you doing here? This is a closed session.”

·        Gil goes up the stairs to talk to the woman. Telling her to let her send a message to Ligoni.

o   The woman shoots down the idea. Saying if there is business with them, Gil can take it up when they’re on break.

·        Gil tries to assert that she needs to get in the simulation. About being an unknown variable for their exervise.

o   Gil cannot tell if this person is a lancer or not.

o   “If you understood how much time I spent getting these exercises together for my squad…”

o   Gil pushes the woman’s shoulder. The woman does not budge. “You’ve seen combat. You know what I’m talking about.”

o   “Yes…I have. I will give you a little reprieve since you’re new here, and overlook the assault of a lancer to the handler of Squad Ligoni. I have a squad to run, I have things to do. Unless you have some official business, I ask you once again to leave my closed session, before I have you removed.”

·        Gil looks around the room in a mix of fake and real astonishment. “Uh yeah. Have me removed actually. Get me the fuck out of here.” She walks to the edge of the steps and waits for security.

  

### Dom

·        As Gil is going towards the sim room, Dom asks how Gil is feeling about all that happened on Cressidium.

o   Gil responds flippantly. Kick-ass dude, I feel awesome. Don’t you?

o   After a bit of silence, Gil says it’s really weird. All this shit.

o   Dom doesn’t understand how Gil can feel awesome after all that went down. What’s so great?

o   To Gil, simply not dying on work is awesome. And then you go home and celebrate. Pauses. Seems they run things a bit differently here. Everyone has checklists and stuff. People don’t seem to have the impression that they’re going to die all the time.

o   Dom: Most of these people aren’t the ones who might die.

o   Gil: Lancers are going out there and killing people, not dying so much.

·        Dom is feeling messed up after the killing, starting to lose it a bit. Gil doesn’t understand why Dom is taking it so hard. Sometimes you have to kill.

o   Dom calms and asks “How do you regulate yourself and shut it off? Just not think?”

o   “Live it up while you’re here, don’t think about it till youre in the field.”

·        Dom doesn’t feel like he belongs in the Crimson Wolves. He wasn’t supposed to be anywhere that got him here. Supposed to be on a dark, cramped, shitty space station in the middle of fucking nowhere. And that station didn’t really prepare me for wearing a guy’s skin and tricking his friends into thinking I’m them, and throwing grenades down elevator shafts. I did shit at home, but nothing like this at all.”

o   Gil is a bit uncomfortable at that.

·        Dom tells Gil that he has backdoors into most of what he needs. The reason he doesn’t belong here is that he found his way in. He made his way in. Does he trust Seline? Sure. No problem giving her what he found. But doesn’t know anyone above her. But he has his own copies of the data.

o   Dom doesn’t know what he wants, but knows he should give the data up.

·        Gil doesn’t quite know what they want in general. No idea about the implants inside her.

·        Dom feels the talk with Gil has been good for camaraderie. Not quite so personally and mentally, but feels a bit more trustful of Gil. Feels that trying to help Gil find out about her implants will balance out the skin-stealing and fragging.

### Bunny

·        Bunny waits for Dom to come back to the suite, meanwhile making her room as she wants.

·        When Dom comes back, Bunny beckons him, but is ignored. She takes out a plushie from her room and hums it at Dom to get his attention.

·        Bunny talks to Dom about the panic attack (both of us). Asking “Hey…We don’t have to talk about that right?”

·        Dom agrees to secrecy, and Bunny returns the favor, though noting that she wasn’t the only person to witness it.

·        She assures Dom that as a teammate and a friend, she will be here for him and everyone else of Lycaon.

·        After Dom expresses his appreciation, Bunny goes back to her room.

### Bethany

·        Bethany sits on her datapad after grilled cheese, looking into what she can find about Anathema.

o   She is part of a third-party Lancer program called Halcyon Crypt. Relatively new. 3 Lancers registered.

o   Finds that Anathema is an officially registered pilot part of the Halcyon Crypt group.

§  Two other pilots listed with no mech. The codenames are “Humble Invention” and “Brooding Wings”

o   Anathema’s mech is not listed with any anomalies. Even as part of a biotech company, Bethany had never heard of any bio-organic stuff like the meat and tendrils we saw on Burning Miseries.

·        Bethany goes to see Gil. Gets to the sim room, and Gil is sitting on the steps waiting to be removed. She calls for Gil to come see.

·        Handler Elizabeth Sharp is not paying attention to Gil anymore, just ignoring her presence.

o   She is a former Lancer, and former Apex-10 member. A founding member of the Crimson Wolves, leading Ligoni, the first Wolf lancer squad.

§  Callsign: Final Flight of the Kestrel

§  Mech: Crashing Cumulus

o   Gil gets up to go with Bethany, flipping off Sharp as she leaves.

·        Bethany knows from her biomed background that lancers are obviously dangerous, and need to have somewhat of a leash on them. The augments have a governor integration. The keys are usually in the possession of their handlers.

·        As Gil is coming, Bethany’s communicator pings.

o   From Seline: “You’re in the sim room, right?”

o   Bethany: “Getting Gil. Leaving now.”

o   Seline: “Good. Get out of there quick.”

·        After leaving the room, Bethany talks about Anathema, and that she knows nothing about the biomechanic workings of Anathema. That there are no anomalies listed on the mech.

·        Halcyon Crypt is either a brand-new third-party, or that the pilots’ data has been scrubbed from the net, which would be very difficult to do, since lancers make a splash no matter what they do.

·        Gil comes from the Reconciliation Project, and doesn’t really know too much about their augment process.

·        Bethany asks why would one of the most decorated lancer groups purchase the contract of a brand-new third-party Lancer who has no record? What could the Reconciliation Project be a part of that the Wolves could find them good and reliable enough at pickings subjects to buy Gil’s contract?

·        As they finish the conversation, by the doorway to the sim room, there is something that takes over the entire hallway. It is very sleek, gunmetal black, looks like its made of porcelain. Human-shaped, but no head. Long arms to its knees.

o   This thing is around 9 feet tall. Can’t see any weapons or joints. It is like a metal statue that was just set in front of the door.

o   Bethany can tell it’s a combat drone, for security.

·        Gil sends Bethany the contact information of her person from Reconciliation Project.

·        Gil points around at the security, and the indoor water wall. “Are you into all of this?”

o   Bethany says it was her purpose in life. She was born to do this.

o   She is to represent the Sinclair Foundation and her father’s work. They spent decades making the perfect soldier, and she is meant to be the test of that.

o   Gil “That’s pretty cool and everything…”

·        Gil is obviously looking for escape routes, thinking she’s slick.

o   Bethany doesn’t care what Gil does, as long as it doesn’t affect our missions. Do whatever you want. Beth’s goal is to find out more about what we are facing. As long as she can work on that, she does not care what Gil does.

  

### Dom

·        Dom immediately gets to work looking for information on Gil’s past.

o   Does so on his datapad in his room.

·        Dom logs into the admin account that he backdoored. The moment so, he gets a security ping. There is a system trying to verify the credentials.

o   The security has been stepped up recently, getting pushback immediately upon login.

o   Dom uses his Subjectivity Enhancement Suite to connect his cables to the tablet.

o   Able to convince the system that he is a real admin account. Starts getting notifications that there have been new security measures and restrictions. New monitoring systems installed.

·        Dom goes into the common area, about to walk out the door, and hears “Not gonna say hi to your guest?” from behind.

o   Dom unplugs and retracts the cable, turning to see Amaq laying on the couch, arms crossed. They tussle their curly hair.

o   “Welcome back! Cressidium is lovely this time of year, huh?”

o   When asked why/how they are here, Amaq comments that the security here is…no it’s as good as you think it is…

·        They point at Dom’s tablet. “That security though, gone up since you left, huh? Apparently there was a leak on Cressidium. Someone let a POW see..” They trail off. “By the way, have you had your infosec remedial training yet?”

·        Dom and Amaq agree to take a walk. Sus. Amaq is talking about their troubles with the lunch menu recently.

o   Against all odds, the nook Amaq mentioned with vine walls and an aquarium does exist. And it is quite nice.

·        Amaq sits down on a circle couch. They lean back and say “If I ever find who makes these, I’m gonna give them the biggest hug. Very soft, isn’t it?”

·        “Ideally, we Lancers would fight for those who can’t fight for themselves. Or help someone who can fight get an edge. We aren’t assassins, per se. But we help. And some people want to kill those we work for. We make sure that that doesn’t happen. And possibly kill them back, of course.”

·        Dom asks how Amaq felt the first time they killed. “Scared…That’s most of it. Scared of what I would do. Where I would go from here? What if they were the one behind me with a knife? What it would be like if I went out that quickly and quietly. And even worse, all the ways that you could not go quickly and quietly. Because I got to see plenty of that too.

·        Amaq asks what Dom wants to find in the Crimson Wolves systems, and what he will do with it? Will you look for a reason to hate them? To vindicate?

o   Dom explains the main reason for the intrusion is because of Amaq. It was our first day, and we are approached by a strange unknown figure with nobody around you knowing who this person is. They say hey come with me. You turn around and they’re gone. Our handler doesn’t know who they are.

·        Amaq asks if hypothetically, one could get higher access to dig deeper, what would it be worth?

o   Dom says the value would be decided by the person with the access.

o   Amaq “Can I level with you? I’m curious to see what you would do with it.”

o   Dom’s tablet pings. His access tier has increased.

·        Dom invites Amaq to Gil’s party. “Interesting. Novel.” Amaq says to take them down as a maybe.

  

### Bunny

·        The next day, Bunny gets a ping from Koa saying she’s at the door.

·        When Bunny answers, Koa flashes a smile and says “So I think I promised you a suit?”

·        Koa leads Bunny to the hub. “Most clothes here are made with fabs, but we do have a person who is in charge of the design fo the uniforms. I’ve convinced them to make suits for me before, wonderful work.”

·        We start getting Bunny fitted for a suit. He does hand measurements and thinks about the design and colors that would work.

·        After the suit is made, Koa goes over making Bunny is looking good. Koa puts her hands on Bunny’s shoulders. “Here’s what you need to know about dating.”

o   Try your best to make it about them.

o   If they are interested in something, pursue it. Ask questions. See what they like. What can I learn about this person?

o   This will be hard since your date is your boss, so I don’t know how it will go, but I have no room to talk.

o   She might not be very forthcoming for that reason. If you aren’t getting anywhere, might need to do small talk.

·        Koa says she has another question. “What do you know about dating?” Nothing.

o   “I’ll give you this one free. When you’re going to date your boss, don’t make the first move as far as kisses and stuff go.”

o   The right advice would be don’t do this. But glass houses, you know?

·        Samantha, the rabbit, also gets a suit made.

  

### Bunny’s date with Seline

·        Seline knocks on Bunny’s door. Bunny straightens up before answering.

·        Seline comments that the suit looks really nice, and she rocks it.

·        As we walk, Seline says she noticed that Bunny’s primary was not in the intake manifest.

o   She has arranged to have another of her sporting pistols retrieved.

·        We get to the shooting range. Unsurprisingly, Koa has the high score. A lot of Ligoni members are high up. It flashes between settings, times, courses, etc.

·        Bunny sees that Seline has a very ergonomic streamlined competition pistol. There is another compact pistol with it, very nice and streamlined. Seline is pre-checking the guns.

·        Seline mentions Makia, which makes Bunny uncomfortable.

o   Says that she is happy that Bunny Is with the wolves.

·        Bunny asks when Seline got into shooting as she does her own checks on the gun she was given. The NDAP, the military branch of Union. Originally, Seline was in an officer’s academy, saw a few deployments, managed a small battalion. When she left, she wanted to keep herself occupied with something familiar.

·        Seline offers Bunny the first round. The targets lurch and move erratically. Bunny does decently well, adjusting to the speed of the targets. She is accurate, and hitting her shots. The gun itself is really nice. Almost nonexistent recoil. Though it’s not made to fit Bunny’s hand, it is very comfortable.

o   Seline comments that it is brilliant, and that Bunny is very fast with her target work.

o   Seline reaches for where her tablet would be, before realizing it isn’t there. She taps on the screen, and Bunny’s name flashes on the scoreboard. Bunny is ranked 25th.

o   Sorry if this is insensitive, but have you ever seen a movie?

·        Seline gestures to the booth, getting in position. She takes the other firearm, fitting perfectly in her hand. Her expression goes blank. She starts plinking targets at the same speed as Bunny’s round. The score racks up, as the targets speed up in response to her speed.

o   She yells out, a bullet ricocheting. She drops the pistol to the ground. The targets are still moving and she still has rounds. She is doubled over.

o   The muscles in her arm are tensed and locked and shaking. There is sweat beading on her forehead, and her eye has a bit of blood in it.

o   “Bunny, the inner left breast pocket.” Inside, there is an injector. She pulls her hair aside, revealing a small metal Kerub port on the back of her neck.

·        Bunny injects into the port, and Seline gasps. Her arms are shaking, and it’s clear it is very painful. She takes deep breaths and is able to move.

·        “So are we going to talk about what that was?”

o   “I just got carried away, that’s all.” She flexes her hand to test it.

·        Seline hits the discontinue button on the tablet, and the targets reset.

o   “I’m so sorry, Bunny. I have to go. Maybe a movie next time?”

o   Bunny is obviously taken aback, and doesn’t really know what to do. Seline hurries away, telling Bunny to just leave the guns on the table.

  

### Gil

·        Gil is called into Seline’s office the morning after the party. She asks how Gil is doing.

·        Seline goes and taps a wall, which opens up to a port. “Please, have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.”

·        Seline pours some glasses of bourbon. Gil shoots it, not taking in this obviously fancy liquor. It is strangely smooth.

·        Seline asks Gil what she knows about Lancers, the process of making them.

o   The augmentation process is incredibly fine-tuned, specific, and very extensive.

o   The augments must be perfect to function with an LC. Gil is a strange case, with her visible deformations from the augments.

o   By all accounts, Gil should not be able to pilot a mech.

·        She mentions that Gil’s augments didn’t take fully, but the integration went flawlessly in her combat data.

·        Gil gets agitated, asking what Seline wants from all of this talk.

o   Seline wants to know how. She knows neither of them can answer that question. And the Reclamation Project is no longer around to answer.

o   Gil doesn’t quite care about the augments, but wants to learn about the Myrmidons.

§  Seline thinks the two are connected, and that the process of Gil getting in, what happened, and getting to the Wolves, is all connected. She wants answers.

·        She recognizes that the Wolves are a large departure from Gil’s past, and that the rules and codes and regiment are unusual to Gil. And that it can be nonsensical at times.

o   Seline apologizes to Gil for her reaction to Gil unwinding on Cressidium. She mistakenly was harsh on Gil for something Gil had no way of knowing would be different from how she would normally operate.

·        Gil accosts Seline of being afraid. That Seline’s boss’s boss’s bosses want answers. And what will happen to Seline if she doesn’t get those answers.

·        Seline mentions the squads are all handled differently.

o   You won’t talk to Arctos. No one does. Seline can’t contact them, simply because she is not needed for their operations.

o   Ligoni are products of Union, through and through. Militaristic. She is sure Ligoni will want to talk to Gil. But it is a matter of respecting their time.

o   Kalak is…well, Koa. Koa gives herself a certain amount of regiment because she is chasing the leaderboard. She wants to be the best Lancer she can be. The best there ever was.

·        Gil has a point with fear though. They made something that can kill so easily. That’s why lancers have a governor. She cannot convince Gil that her interest is not due to the investors. But whatever the Reclamation Project did, it’s interesting. And you’ve seen now what they did after you.

o   Seline reaches into her pocket and pulls out a long, black cigarette. “You smoke?”

·        Seline would like for Gil to trust her, which she recognizes may be hard to do. She wants answers, and will be moving in that direction. But to accomplish what they both want, they need a certain amount of unity. Squads need a leader. And she wants to extend that offer to Gil.

o   Gil goes into how the description of the other squads describes different forms of cowardice. But notes that Seline indirectly mentioned being afraid of Gil.

o   Gil accepts the offer and pours another drink. Starts confident, but her hand begins to shake. She tries to smoothly shoot the last glass, but it’s a little too full.

o   She stands up, unsteadily making her way out of the room.
