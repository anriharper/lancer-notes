Callsign: Anathema
LC: Burning Miseries
Affiliation: Unknown (Freelancer?)
Status: Deceased (Killed by [[Gil Gallant]])

A hostile lancer that appeared on Cressidium during [[Operation Solstice Rain]]. Fought on the side of the [[Vestan Sovereignty]] to defend the hostage Union ambassador and captain of the Rio Grande ship. Fought against Squad Lycaon before being defeated. Her mech entered a meltdown and exploded, killing her.

Little is known of Anathema or her affiliation. Sovereignty forces referred to a freelancer shortly before Anathema appeared. 

Anathema's LC, Burning Miseries, uses a Smith-Shimano Corpro Metalmark frame. The frame itself was anomalous, in that whenever a hole was created, it would be pathced up by a semi-meaty sinew-like substance. After an arm was severed, Burning Miseries was able to use this sinew to still wield a weapon in the place of the missing arm. Utilized a high-energy plasma rifle capable of devastating damage against mecha.
