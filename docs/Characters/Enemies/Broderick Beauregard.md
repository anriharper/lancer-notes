Affiliation: [[Vestan Sovereignty]]<br>Status: Deceased (Killed by [[Bunny]])

A Sovereignty MC pilot who initially appeared in the squad that hunted [[Index|Squad Lycaon]] after their ship was shot down. Broderick first piloted a support MC designed to repair damaged units. His MC was disabled, and he was taken prisoner by [[Bunny]], eventually escaping in the chaos of a subsequent battle.

Broderick later reappeared in a new Devastator MC as [[Index|Squad Lycaon]] assaulted a transmission tower that the [[Vestan Sovereignty]] was using to jam communicaitons. Broderick was defeated again, and [[Bunny]] killed him with her daggers.
