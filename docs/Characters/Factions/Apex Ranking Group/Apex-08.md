Callsign: Xenon Blue
LC: Crown of Virtue's Casualty

"From the darkest reaches, a ray of hope shines."

---

Following her extrication and deprogramming from the Cult of Verisimilitude by the Naval Liaison Service in 5009u,  Xenon Blue became enamored with the mechanized infantry of the NDAP. Integration into the Union lancer program was complicated by her already extensive augmentation, having been converted into an android over the course of a decade as part of the cult’s Walk of a Thousand Connections. However, in less than a year of being cleared for LC operations, Xenon’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. She is currently placed in a special combined NLS-NDAP task force which operates primarily in the periphery and has been attributed to the dissolution of human trafficking rings, polities which the Union has deemed dangerous, and cults similar to the one Xenon was previously indoctrinated into.

The Crown of Virtue’s Casualty was designed by former ISP and SSC engineers to complement Xenon Blue’s strengths. Typically armed with head-mounted Laser Knife delivery systems, a pair of Cutter Mk-III Plasma Torches, and a Vulture DMR, the Crown is fielded with balance in mind due to the unpredictability of Xenon’s missions. However, its hallmark feature is a novel drone bit system: armored plates, connected directly to Xenon via neural link, which can detach for a number of configurations and functions. One leaked mission recording made waves on the omninet late last year shows the system carving apart an HA Ghengis within seconds, leaving the cockpit intact. 

While the Union has a storied history of producing incredible lancers despite their relatively small naval force, the APEX group is nevertheless impressed to state that Xenon Blue has broken the record for fastest induction into the APEX-10 from first sortie. The level of refinement in her piloting and mastery of advanced systems is possibly only overshadowed by our estimation that we have yet to see her in her prime. For this reason, we have named Xenon Blue this year's Most Anticipated Pilot.
