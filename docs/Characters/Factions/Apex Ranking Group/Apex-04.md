Callsign: Hills Bleed in Amaranth
LC: Seventh Solstice

"Death from beyond the horizon"

---

Hills Bleed in Amaranth utilizes a low-to-mid orbit targeting system that xe developed for extreme range engagements, with confirmed kills up to 7.3 km away. Seventh Solstice’s tetrapod configuration may be reminiscent of SSC’s Death’s Head platform, with much of its carrying capacity dominated by its Xenith-Tau “Ballista” railgun system. However, the Solstice outclasses the Death’s Head in every regard:  compact drone swarms, the XT Ballista’s ability to be reconfigured mid-engagement to fire within typical LC combat range, and surprising maneuverability all make the Solstice devastating at any range. The draw of Amaranth’s ability to pick off targets at extraordinary distances in quick success often overshadows xer success rate in close quarters and extravehicular infiltration, but a combination of the two is what lands xer so high in APEX rankings. 

The engineering of nearly every facet of the Solstice was developed by Amaranth xerself, and was manufactured at a remote facility isolated printing machinery which xe has stated is wiped of all memory after each build. Amaranth is known to be stingy regarding repairs and maintenance, doing as much on xer own and refusing to utilize any printing systems that are not xer own. Xe is currently contracted with SSC, though historically xe has been a black op freelancer and is estimated to have been involved in over 150 political assassinations across settled space. 

While xer combat record has taken years to piece together, the APEX Group has recently been able to attribute 78 MC and 21 LC kills to Amaranth during the Sanjak Rebellion alone. First hand accounts from the conflict frequently tell of mechs suddenly exploding, being torn to shreds, or going silent only to be found still standing upright with a hole in the cockpit. A surviving militant of Free Sanjak was quoted recalling the events of the Battle at Ynneval’s Throne, saying “My squad leader just… she was there, y’see? And then she wasn’t. Just metal and guts plastered against the rocks.”
