Callsign: Tsar<br>LC: Koeschi's Last Breath

"Vires intus Numeris"

---

Tsar was initially fielded in the NDAP’s 134th Vanguard Division in an HA Tokugawa frame and saw heavy use in various conflicts in the periphery. His leadership abilities caught the eye of the Crimson Wolves, and today he is arguably the heart of the organization’s lancer project. While his individual skill set is exactly what one would expect of an APEX-10 member, Tsar truly shines in his ability to bring out the best of those around him, and lead squads with deadly efficacy. 

Koeschi’s Last Breath may look far removed from its origins as a Tokugawa, with its streamlined black frame hiding a host of various systems, but functionally it is still designed to lead from the front in close-quarters combat. Wrist-mounted combat shotguns and vijaya rockets compliment a quartet of cutlass-configuration torches. Tsar has also fitted a back-mounted holster for his Bolide Mk 3 rocket-propelled DMR, and his signature Halcyon Lance is mounted onto the opposite shoulder. While the number of weapons packed into Koeschi’s Last Breath may invoke the image of a heavily loaded, slow moving brawler, this could not be further from the truth. Lightweight alloys and a specialized reactor allow for fast movement and high agility, keeping Tsar nimble in combat. This compliments the Crimson Wolves’ pack tactics and has led to Squad Ligoni being its core lancer group. In over 150 sorties across several dozen systems, Squad Ligoni has suffered zero casualties under his command, despite on average being outnumbered 3.75:1 in full combat scenarios. 

Tsar’s preference to add poached Union pilots to the ranks of the Wolves has been well-documented, and his own squad composition has more ex-Union pilots than not. His influence on the structure and dealings of the Wolves is a testament to his diplomacy in and out of combat, as it is believed that Tsar is responsible for the close contracting between the Wolves and the Union. Whether this is legend or truth, his ability to organize lancers into a single orchestral unit has shaped one of the foremost mercenary groups in the galaxy.
