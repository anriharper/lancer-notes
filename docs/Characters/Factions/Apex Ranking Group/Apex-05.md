Callsign: Wing-III, Fortuna
MC: Ochre Procession

"Sword of the Union"

---

The only Erel-augmented pilot to gain entry to the NADP Flight of Valkyries, and currently the only in the APEX-10, Wing-III Fortuna is a marvel of a pilot. Whether by personal choice or physical limitations, Fortuna has only undergone minimal additional augmentation and, given she cannot pilot an LC, is not classified as a lancer. Nonetheless, her combat sense and prowess are perhaps second-to-none, even amongst our top ten pilots. 

UFMC-91 Ochre Procession is a relatively new MC, though still very dated by LC standards. Fortuna typically sorties with a large, 11th generation flight unit to match the Valkyries' famous aerial tactics, and despite the limitations of this technology is considered their most agile pilot. Aside from this, the blocky platform is kitted very conservatively with an adapted GMS T-1 assault rifle, a thermal pistol, and an Aunic Claymore-class beam saber for melee combat. 

Fortuna has been deployed throughout the entirety of the Second Distal War, initially as part of an MC detachment in the Boundary Garden during the inciting battle in 5000u. After remainder of her battalion was decimated in the initial attack, Fortuna had brought down thirteen Ofanim squads, ten ground-to-orbit defense placements, six Ofanim fabrication centers, three Glories, and a Line Commander by the time a contingent from Fansipan Station found her mapping an Aunic enclave two weeks later and extricated her.  

Fortuna was inducted into the Valkyries on the arrival of the Battlegroup Comet, taking the title Wing-III, and was one of the few remaining survivors when Fansipan Station fell in 5014u. By then, legend of the infamous Wraith of the Boundary Garden had spread far and wide within the Ascendancy. The Union’s Demon, they say, will not rest until the Gardens runs red with the blood of the Chosen.
