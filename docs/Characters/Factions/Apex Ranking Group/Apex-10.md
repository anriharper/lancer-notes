Callsign: Mipung Glaive<br>LC: Qianlima Mk 2

"The blade polished by an untold age"

---

Leading the Albatross for the past two centuries, Mipung Glaive is fabled to be one of the first to ever undergo Kerub augmentation. Tracking their combat statistics has been surprisingly difficult despite the extraordinary length of their operation, complicated by the lore which has developed surrounding Albatross and the unique time dilation which they utilize in interstellar travel. 

The Qianlima Mk 2 is a heavily modified Nelson ISP-N Striker Frame, the Albatross’s favored frame. Qianlima’s miniature warp drive and nanolight coating allow it to move even more freely than the standard frame while being exceedingly difficult to track. Mipung Glaive has also fitted their LC with decoy flares, specialized in countering drone systems, and typically sorties with a pair of modified rocket war pikes affectionately named Ji and Jin. Their propulsion systems allow the Qianlima to close into threat range at lightning speed and deliver high impact blows at the cost of handling.   

Over the years, Mipung Glaive has been noted to use an impressive catalog of melee weaponry and flex systems, making them an unpredictable threat in battle. Decades of training and missions have honed them into a blade which cuts through enemy lines with precision and grace. Many names have been attributed to them across the galaxy: Glaive of the Single Cut,  Feather on Dawn’s Wind, The Sword Saint of Zhen-Vel. Determining that each of these, and many more, entities are one in the same took years of careful research and a mountain of compiled data. Their spot at Rank 10 reflects their most recent sorties, and the ranking group is confident that Mipung Glaive will retain a place in the APEX-10 for many years still to come.
