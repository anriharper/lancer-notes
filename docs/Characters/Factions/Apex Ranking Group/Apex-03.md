Callsign: Red Mura<br>LC: The Nails of Mahuika

"Wrath of the Fire Goddess"

---

Initially trained under the private military group House of Nebulae, Red Mura has always been known for her deadly accuracy and ruthless tactics. Footage from Hem’s Strait and various other sorties under the command of her former PMG is widespread, often showing Mura standing amidst the burning wreckage of target bases or holding the head of a famous LC. 

The Nails is a bespoke variant of the Monarch platform, designed by the great Bella Di Luca herself to make optimal use of Mura’s talent for tracking a multitude of targets while still lending itself to her performance as perhaps the best single-target fighter to ever pilot an LC. Its signature weapon, Burning Nails, is a guided energy delivery system which passes an incredible amount of current between the five Nails and their targets, vaporizing most metals on contact and causing lethal burns to pilots even inside heavier armored cockpits. The exact nature of the core powering this system is proprietary to the designer, who took its secrets to the grave as her magnum opus. Mura supplements her finishing weapon with a combination of guided missile systems, shoulder mounted chase guns, and a pair of plasma revolvers.  

She was drafted into the Crimson Wolves under the wing of famed Lancer Gate of Palms, a former APEX-10 alum. The contract required her to work with two Lancers: APEX Rank 17a and 17b, Citra and Bulan. Together the trio is widely considered to be the single best Lancer squad currently in operation, each complimenting each other to form a nearly unassailable front. 

Red Mura is still known to challenge notable pilots to single combat, and she currently holds the title for the most APEX-10 pilots defeated at six downs within the past eight years. As the majority of her triumphs ended in the death of an APEX-10 member, Mura is often referred to as the Butcher of the APEX-10. The APEX Group, as well as the galaxy at large, is looking forward to her inevitable matchup against longtime rival Coiled Viper, as the Butcher is known to primarily target higher ranking pilots.
