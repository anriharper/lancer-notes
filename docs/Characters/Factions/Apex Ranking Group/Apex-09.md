Callsign: HA-V Dulcimer<br>LC: Helzen Fortress

"An armor battalion on four legs"

---

The youngest great grandson of the legendary Harrison I, HA-V Dulcimer grew up more interested in piloting mechs than selling them. He was fast-tracked through the Armory’s top lancer program and excelled with their heavier frames, leading him to work closely with Armory engineers to test LC limits.

During the Richter-Plante Conglomerate Incursion of 5012, Dulcimer was deployed to Ras Shamra, where he first gained the attention of the APEX Ranking Group through his unconventional but devastatingly effective piloting of the modified Barbarossa: Unclaimed Mantle. Short-range boost jets, lightweight alloys, and a novel drone bit system proved to significantly improve the Barbarossa’s commonly known weaknesses at the cost of higher heat generation. The event landed him a place in the Armory’s personal lancer squadron.  

His current frame, Helzen Fortress, is believed to be the largest LC to ever be fielded. The unique systems of Unclaimed Mantle were perfected and integrated into the Fortress, which is said to be more of a mobile artillery and drone carried platform than mech. However, Dulcimer pilots the behemoth alone with the assistance of the AI system Kelpie Station, and has been determined by the APEX board to qualify as an LC. Armed with two Apocalypse Rails, a twin SOL Pattern canon,  a four drum drone dispensary, and eight pairs of forward facing Stub Cannons, the Fortress bristles with weaponry. Perhaps its most frightening aspect is its speed and agility despite its size, owing to its multi-core fission system which can utilize a city’s worth of energy within the course of a single sortie. 

The high demands of both pilot skill, endurance, and energy needs of the platform make it highly unlikely that the Armory will mass distribute the model. The APEX Group estimates only a handful of pilots could operate the system, a testament to Dulcimer’s unique skill.
