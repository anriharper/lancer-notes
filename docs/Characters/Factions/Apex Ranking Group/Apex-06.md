Callsign: L1<br>LC: Tempest Engine

"Through sacrifice, we seize victory."

---

Headmaster of the Makia Academy and leader of the Fearless Striders’ lancer squad, L1 has stood as a pillar of excellence for lancers for nearly thirty years. Graduating from Makia’s inaugural class of 4988, L1 went on to prove his mettle in the field before being selected to lead the academy, and is currently the longest standing member of the APEX-10 with 15 years of tenure. L1 reshaped the operations of the Fearless Striders and cultivated an academy which produces few, but nevertheless elite, lancers with excellent mission records which speak to L1’s ability as Headmaster.  

Tempest Engine was built using a modified HA Sherman core and designed to weaponize heat generation to its fullest extent. The original ZF4 SOLIDCORE weapon system has gone through a number of iterations, now utilizing a power bank system to allow for more fine-tuned burst fire accompanied by an overclocking system which allows it to build charge faster. The open aperture in the chest plate revealing the core gives the Tempest Engine its name, generating large amounts of heat and shunting it both to the modified ZF4 as well as a pair of wrist mounted laser cannons which were adapted from the Andromeda Pattern Rifle. An intricate venting system allows L1 to stabilize extraordinary excess heat through explosive decompression - burning anyone unfortunate enough to be within the radius. Perhaps his most seldom used yet most famous weapon is the FSLx-01 Vice Core: a heavy plasma claw capable of tearing standard-sized frames in half. The weapon is very volatile, generates an enormous amount of heat, and is typically reserved for desperate situations.   

Combat against L1 has been described as fighting uphill against a river of molten iron. Despite the inherent violence in his frame, L1 is a graceful and seasoned pilot, picking his openings carefully through the guise of a battle of attrition. Close examination of his sorties reveals a methodical nature refined by years of experience, and we do not expect L1 to leave the APEX-10 any time soon.
