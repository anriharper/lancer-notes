Role: Unknown

While their handler was held up in an unexpected meeting, Amaq approached the newly arrived Squad Lycaon and offered to help the fledgling lancer group find their way around Gatarobi Station.

After seemingly vanishing upon the arrival of Handler Nguyen, Amaq was later confirmed to be within the Crimson Wolves' records, albeit with heavy file access restrictions which the handler was not privy to. She posited that Amaq was likely either a member of the clandestine Squad Arctos or part of the Wolves' Central Intelligence group. Whatever the case, Amaq showed great interest in meeting the new lancers.
