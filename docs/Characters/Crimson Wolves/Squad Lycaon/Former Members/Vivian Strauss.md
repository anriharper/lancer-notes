Vivian Strauss has spent centuries exploring deep space with a Union Far-Field Team. An incredibly dangerous line of work, FFTs explore and catalogue the unknown where time and space bend far beyond human understanding. She returned from her final mission and enrolled in the Union Academy of Mechanized Cavalry at Titania, graduating rank 1.

Specializing in devastation at all ranges, Event Horizon is a feat of engineering. A combination of rocket propelled grenades, a GMS Type-B AR, and a tungsten alloy greataxe ensure that Vivian is able to adapt most any enemy, and kill it. Her own engineering skills and modifications make the Event Horizon able to fight in the harshest conditions and through the most deadly of encounters. It is best when allowed full mobility, quickly switching between multiple targets to use its weapon systems efficiently.

Vivian is a Cosmopolitan and understandable reserved, likely as a result. A small team is the best fit, to allow her the opportunity to make deeper connections.

**Note from handler [[Seline Nguyen]]**: To think she's been around longer than the Wolves, longer than some civilizations. I wonder what she saw out there just beyond the edge of the known, and what made her come back after all that time away. Whatever she's looking for now, I hope we can help her find it.
