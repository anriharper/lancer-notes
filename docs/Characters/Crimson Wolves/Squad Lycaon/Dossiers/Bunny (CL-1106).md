Bunny graduated rank 1 from Makia Academy and was immediately selected for the Fearless Striders' Lancer program. Scouting quickly confirmed Bunny's devastating efficiency in combat; her time at Makia has already distinguished her as a preeminent pilot of her generation.

Excelling at long range firefights, Bunny's Muzzled Angel is able to pick off targets long before they can reach engagement distance. Squadmates specializing in short/mid range should focus on creating lines of sight for her to allow maximum efficacy. They should likewise rely on Bunny's excellently cultivated marksman sense, and her own ability to create opportunities to secure kills. If the mission is target neutralization, build it around her. Overwatch and recon roles should also be considered, as the Angel is equipped with a smart scope with an effective range of two miles and ability to broadcast feed to squadmates.

Bunny is quick to make friends. Placement with larger squads is preferred, as well as coordinated assignments utilizing multiple squads.

**Note from handler [[Seline Nguyen]]**: Learn the names of her stuffed animals. Great talking point, don't forget them. As an aside, let's find a rifle that can better keep up with that smart scope.
