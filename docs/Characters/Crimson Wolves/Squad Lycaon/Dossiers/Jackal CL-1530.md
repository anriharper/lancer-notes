Domenic traveled halfway across space to attend the prestigious Union Academy of Mechanized Cavalry at Deimos. Though the methods he employed to enroll at UAMC Deimos were not conventional, he quickly distinguished himself as a pilot of great promise. 

Retrovertigo is a prime example of the base of fire principle which UAMC Deimos graduates utilize to great effect across settled space. A well-balanced mix of heavy firepower, drone deployment, and Everest's core systems allow this Everest platform to destroy targets as well as it can provide overwatch for squadmates. Its core values are well known to Ligoni's Crowned Mongrel and Richter, both piloted by fellow UAMC Deimos alumni Duke and Baranof. Platofmr is best suited for close to mid-range engagements while allowing fellow squadmates to move into optimal position and bring down enemy mechs.

Domenic is reserved but highly driven. If life does not give him an open door, he will find a way to make it open. Needs to be paired with other pilots who are similarly driven and will encourage him to face the coming challenges head on.

**Note from handler [[Seline Nguyen]]**: Don't be distracted by the heavy arms build. Domenic has cracked Union systems without any formal training in E-warfare. Let's cultivate that too.
