Heiress to the Sinclair Biomed Group. One of the youngest pilots to undergo Kerub augmentation in history, Bethany boasts cutting edge implants even by Lancer standards. She graduated as valedictorian of the famous Galileo University while certifying with Union's Rising Angels and perofrming for the prestigious L'or du Lac ballet company.

The Everest platform White Swan is tailored to Bethany's aggressive seek-and-destroy tactics. Sinclair Biomed studied LCs such as Red Mura's Nails of Mahuika, Coiled Viper's Vasuki's Fangs, and even APEX Rank 1, Ground Zero when developing the platform. It is built for relentless assaults to deliver maximum damage to single targets. Squadmates should focus on allowing White Swan ideal positioning to sweep weakened foes.

Bethany is a very goal-oritented person. She sees her destination and finds the quickest path to get there. Recommend finding pilots of similar talent if she is to work in a group, as she is unlikely to respect anything short of extraordinary.

**Note from handler Seline Nguyen**: Heavy is the crown, whether it be in the measure of achievement or expectation. Bethany is one of the most talented pilots we have ever seen, certainly the one with the most funds backing her training. I wonder how high the swan can fly, if she doesn't rely on others?
