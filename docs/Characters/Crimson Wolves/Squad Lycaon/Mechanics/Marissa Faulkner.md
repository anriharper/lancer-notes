A lead designer for the Smith-Shimano Corporation who created the Monarch frame for [[Bunny#Muzzled Angel|Muzzled Angel]], contracted as the personal mechanic for [[Bunny]].

Marissa Faulkner is a slightly tall androgynous person (they/them pronouns, but they accept any and all) generally seen in all black with glasses, wearing their hair straight, with their bangs swept over one eye. Marissa's general demeanor can best be described as "disinterested", though they take great care in the service of [[Bunny#Muzzled Angel|Muzzled Angel]]. They are obsessive with the maintenance, and neurotic about the care of the LC that they refer to as their baby. Goes by Misc. (pronounced miss) Faulkner in formal situations.

Faulkner was chosen to create a line of SSC Monarch frames. Though a Monarch designer usually only designs ten frames, Faulkner begged for an exception to be made for them to build an eleventh when they saw the specs requested by [[Bunny]]. The exception was granted, and after completion of the frame, Faulkner decided to stay with the [[Bunny#Muzzled Angel|Muzzled Angel]] rather than retiring to work as her mechanic.
