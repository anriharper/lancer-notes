Placing number 3 in the APEX pilot ranking system, Koa Palmer leads Squad Kalak under the callsign Red Mura and piltos a bright red LC called Nails of Mahuika. Despite her brash and boisterous personality, Koa has made a name for herself as a brilliant tactician in the field. It is believed that even the most unorganized group of lancers would work in perfect concert with her leadership.

Since gaining attention as the sole surviving lancer at the Battle of Hem's Strait, Koa has gone on to lead well over 200 successful sorties. Her Nails of Mahuika has six tally marks on the left shoulder, each for a former top 10 APEX ranked pilot that she downed.

# The Nails of Mahuika

Using a highly modified SSC Monarch platform, the Nails of Mahuika is a versatile LC capable of devastating large numbers of targets within an unbelievably large readius. The unique core of the Nails was developed by the late Bella Di Luca, lead designer of the Monarch as well as the remainder of SSC's **BELLA CIAO** combat line, and tailored to Koa's unique skillset. OLink neural pattern targeting allows Koa to quickly assign payload priority without detracting from the Nails' main weapon systems function.
