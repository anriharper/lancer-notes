This training exercise turns out to have been anything but. We were called to battle stations with very little notice. Barely even had enough time to put my suit on before being pushed into Muzzled Angel's cockpit. Lycaon was loaded onto a dropship to get to the ground, but we were shot out of the sky. The city was already torn to shreds. We had incoming MCs from the Sovereignty and we got radio transmissions that they were to "clean up" any survivors. I made sure to make it well known we survived by shooting a hole through the first mech I saw. They were quite surprised to find out they were not fighting Union soldiers, but rather Lancers from the Crimson Wolves.

We lucked out at one point. Enemy reinforcements had arrived from the north, but Red Mura was just in time to give us a hand, taking them all out at once. I'll need to thank her later. Her assist left one hostile mech, which I disabled. The pilot, a shitbag named Broderick, surrendered to us and gave us a laser designator to call in a bombardment from the Sovereignty.

After assisting some liberators in fixing their transport, we came under fire from Sovereignty forces during escort. Unfortunately, we lost the bus and had to retreat. During the commotion, Broderick somehow escaped from Gecko, who was holding him in their mech. I tried my best to kill him, as I promised Ms. Nguyen I would if he tried to run. But he got awayâ€¦ If I ever see him again, I will not fail my handler a second time.

On our approach to our FOB, we came across a Sovereignty-controlled train yard. There was a Typhoon Rainmaker shooting down CW dropships, hiding behind the train cars in the yard. Likely the same one that hit us on the way down. It was a little touch-and-go for a while, but we were able to get the platform to rotate and expose the Rainmaker. I ended up using the bombardment we got from our prisoner to target it, and we were able to destroy it. Afterward, I had Angel take the head as a trophy.

We got to our FOB after, and it was well past dark. We were welcomed by the Wolves who were there, and our mechs have been taken in for repair. Ms. Nguyen called and said that we would be getting access to some new toys after our successful mission. Looking forward to seeing what we have.

We have been told we will have some downtime tomorrow. If there are any ships heading back to the Rio Grande, I will have to ask if someone can take the Rainmaker head and bring it to my room.
