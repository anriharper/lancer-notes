It is hard to summarize my thoughts. Everything is happening so quickly.

I escaped from the Fearless Striders roughly a month ago. I have decided that I will keep my daggers and the lieutenant's gun though. It took me a while to process that moment. I do not regret killing him. But I do regret that I had to. If he saw me running, he would have killed me. And getting his gun made it possible for me to fend for myself on the way out. I was in hiding with a Crimson Wolves contact while the heat cooled a bit. Then I was stuck on a ship with a bunch of people who looked at me funny. They were respectful, sure, but they made it very clear that I stand out. Eventually, we got to Gatarobi Station. Never heard of it. Don't even know where we were. But it was there I met my new squad, and my handler.

They seem nice enough. I am still gauging how much to let them know about me. No doubt they've noticed I don't have a name by now. But if I am to be relying on these people to keep me safe, and they rely on me for the same, then I am sure there will be time for us to bond.

Unfortunately, we were immediately assigned to a mission upon reaching Gatarobi. We got some time to get accustomed to our quarters, but our luggage had not come by the time we were leaving. So I didn't even get a chance to unpack. All of my friends are still in the suitcase. I did get my hardsuit though. This thing will stay in my closet. I hate it. But I need to hold on to it. As a reminder of what I left, and what keeps me going. The Wolves have supplied a new hardsuit for me with a jump kit. I will have to get used to that, but I feel in time I will prefer that much more than the bulky armor I was wearing before.

We are currently above a planet called Cressidium. Supposed to just be some training by the sound of it, shouldn't be too much action. Most of the time so far has been staying in the gym, having some sparring matches with Koa Palmer, and eating whenever I can. Handler says I can eat as much as I like, as long as I am keeping active. I plan to hold her to that.

Our handler, Seline Nguyen. Over the past few days since I've met her, she seems to actually care for our squad. Making sure we eat enough, get proper exercise, check up on us. Very much unlike the Striders. I have caught myself thinking about her during my free time. I have this urge to do my best for her, this woman I barely know. I want her to have pride in me. I cannot explain this feeling. But I will bring it up to her in the near future.
