Location: Cressidium
Result: LSA Victory

Known Participants:
- [[Leandric States Alliance]]

A civil war broke out on the planet of Cressidium between the LSA and Sovereignty factions. The [[Vestan Sovereignty]] did not wish to join with Union, so they kidnapped the Union ambassador that was visiting. [[Crimson Wolves]] lancers were in the sector to oversee the Union ambassador's visit, and were deployed to combat once he was kidnapped. 

Squad Lycaon was successful in freeing the ambassador, and Squad Kalak was successful in suppressing Sovereignty forces afterwards.
